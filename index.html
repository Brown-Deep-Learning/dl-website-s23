              Over the past few years, Deep Learning has become a popular area,
              with deep neural network methods obtaining state-of-the-art
              results on applications in computer vision (Self-Driving Cars),
              natural language processing (Google Translate), and reinforcement
              learning (AlphaGo). These technologies are having transformative
              effects on our society, including some undesirable ones (e.g. deep
              fakes).

              This course is there to give students a practical understanding of
              how Deep Learning works, how to implement neural networks, and how
              to apply them ethically. We introduce students to the core
              concepts of deep neural networks and survey the techniques used to
              model complex processes within the contexts of computer vision and
              natural language processing.

              critically about potential ethical pitfalls that can result from
              mis-application of these powerful models. The course is taught
              using the Tensorflow deep learning framework.
